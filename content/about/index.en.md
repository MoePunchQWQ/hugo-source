### Why Do I Want to Write a Blog?
I’m a super talkative person who feels like they’ll die if they don’t surf the internet intensely every day. This makes me one of the most active members in many QQ groups. Thanks to having a ton of ideas all the time, I decided to restart my blog to better record my thoughts. I had set up a blog before, but it was abandoned shortly after. I hope this time I can keep it going!

### About This Blog
Built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework with the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. Images are hosted on postimage, and the domain was purchased on nameSilo. I haven’t had time to further refine it, but I’ll definitely keep working on it when I get the chance! The positive feedback from building a blog is immediate—every small change shows visible results (￣y▽,￣)╭.
